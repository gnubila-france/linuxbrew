# Linuxbrew

Linuxbrew is a fork of [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), the Mac OS package manager, for Linux.

Features, usage and installation instructions are [summarised on the homepage](http://brew.sh/linuxbrew/).

Install Linuxbrew (tl;dr)
-------------------------

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

``` sh
ruby -e "$(wget -O- https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)"
```

See [Dependencies](#dependencies) and [Installation](#installation) below for more details.

Features
--------

+ Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo
+ Install software not packaged by the native distribution
+ Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old
+ Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines

Dependencies
------------

* **Ruby** 1.8.6 or newer
+ **GCC** 4.2 or newer

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

### Debian or Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git m4 ruby texinfo libbz2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat-dev libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### Fedora

```sh
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' && sudo yum install curl git m4 ruby texinfo bzip2-devel curl-devel expat-devel ncurses-devel zlib-devel
```

Installation
------------

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

``` sh
ruby -e "$(wget -O- https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)"
```

Or if you prefer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew.git ~/.linuxbrew
```

Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
export MANPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH"
export INFOPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH"
```

You're done!

```sh
brew install $WHATEVER_YOU_WANT
```

## Something broke!

Many of the Homebrew formulae work on either Mac or Linux without changes, but some formulae will need to be adapted for Linux. If a formula doesn't work, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/issues) or, even better, submit a pull request.

## Security
Please report security issues to security@brew.sh.
